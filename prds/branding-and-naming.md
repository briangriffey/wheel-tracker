**dispatched_by: branding_team**
**Status**: ✅ **DECISION MADE - GreekWheel Selected**
**Domain Acquired**: greekwheel.com

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the branding and naming strategy for the Wheel Tracker application - a comprehensive Next.js web application for tracking options trading using the wheel strategy. The goal is to establish a strong brand identity with a memorable name, consistent visual identity, and clear market positioning that resonates with options traders while conveying professionalism and trustworthiness.

**🎉 FINAL DECISION: GreekWheel**
- **Domain Secured**: greekwheel.com ✅
- **Decision Date**: February 14, 2026
- **Rationale**: Combines technical credibility (Greeks) with wheel strategy focus, appeals to sophisticated traders who understand options fundamentals

## Current State

**Application Overview:**
- Full-featured options trading tracker built with Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- Specialized in the "wheel strategy" (cash-secured PUTs → stock assignment → covered CALLs)
- Target users: Individual options traders, retail investors using systematic options strategies
- Current name: "Wheel Tracker" (functional but generic)
- Current color scheme: Green-based palette (#43D984)
- 409+ tests, comprehensive features including P&L tracking, benchmarking, trade management

**Branding Gaps:**
- Generic name lacks market differentiation
- No formal brand identity or guidelines
- Missing logo and visual assets
- No brand story or positioning statement
- Limited emotional connection with target users

## Target State

**Brand Vision:**
- Establish a distinctive brand that conveys: precision, systematic trading, growth, and confidence
- Create a name that is memorable, professional, and domain-available
- Develop comprehensive brand guidelines including colors, typography, voice
- Build trust with options trading community through authoritative branding
- Position as the premier tool for systematic options trading

## Problem Statement

Options traders need a tool that not only tracks their trades but also instills confidence in their systematic approach. The current "Wheel Tracker" name is functional but doesn't capture the emotional journey of building wealth through disciplined trading. We need a brand that resonates with traders who view the wheel strategy as a methodical path to consistent income generation.

### Decision Criteria Matrix

| Name | Domain Available (.com) | Domain Available (.io) | Memorable | Professional | Unique | Total Score |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| WheelVault | ✅ LIKELY | ✅ LIKELY | 9/10 | 9/10 | 8/10 | 26/30 |

**Domain Research Update (Feb 14, 2026):**
- Initial research indicates that wheelvault.com, thetawheel.com, and optionorbit.com are NOT resolving to active websites
- This strongly suggests these domains are available for registration
- Corresponding .io domains also appear to be available

**FINAL DECISION (Feb 14, 2026):**
- ✅ **GreekWheel selected as final brand name**
- ✅ **greekwheel.com successfully acquired**
- 🔄 **Next**: Secure greekwheel.io and greekwheel.app for brand protection

### Final Recommendation

~~Based on strategic analysis, **WheelVault** is the recommended brand name~~

### ✅ FINAL DECISION: GreekWheel

**Decision Rationale:**

GreekWheel was selected as the final brand name for the following strategic reasons:

1. ✅ **Technical Authority**: Direct reference to options Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) establishes immediate credibility with educated traders
2. ✅ **Target Audience Alignment**: Appeals to sophisticated traders who understand options fundamentals, not casual investors
3. ✅ **Educational Positioning**: Positions the app as a tool for serious traders who "speak Greek"
4. ✅ **Memorable Compound**: Two strong words that reinforce each other (Greeks + Wheel)
5. ✅ **Market Differentiation**: Not currently used in options trading software space
6. ✅ **SEO Strength**: Unique brand name + relevant keywords for options trading
7. ✅ **Community Resonance**: r/thetagang and options communities already use "Greeks" heavily in discussions
8. ✅ **Scalability**: Can expand to cover multiple options strategies while maintaining Greek focus

**Why GreekWheel Works:**
- **For beginners**: Aspirational - "Learn the Greeks, master the Wheel"
- **For experienced traders**: Validation - "I know my Greeks, this tool is for me"
- **For the brand**: Clear positioning as a premium, education-focused trading tool
